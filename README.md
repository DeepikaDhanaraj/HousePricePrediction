## HousePricePrediction
Develop a machine learning model to predict the sale price of residential properties based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and other relevant factors. The goal is to create an accurate and reliable predictive model that can assist homeowners, real estate agents, and property investors in estimating the market value of houses, thereby facilitating informed decision-making processes in buying, selling, or investing in residential real estate properties.
